# Journal App

## Overview
The Journal App is a robust application built using **Spring Boot** to manage journal entries efficiently. It incorporates advanced features such as **Spring Security**, **Redis**, and **Kafka**, along with **JUnit** and **Mockito** for testing. This project demonstrates CRUD operations for managing journals and serves as a learning experience in implementing enterprise-grade technologies.

## Features
- **CRUD Operations**: Create, Read, Update, and Delete journal entries.
- **Spring Security**: Secures the application with authentication and role-based access control.
- **Redis Integration**: Caching mechanism for improved performance.
- **Kafka Integration**: Reliable event-driven communication.
- **Testing Frameworks**: Comprehensive testing using **JUnit** and **Mockito**.

---

## Technologies Used
- **Spring Boot**: Framework for building Java-based applications.
- **Spring Security**: Secure authentication and authorization.
- **Redis**: Distributed caching system.
- **Apache Kafka**: Distributed event streaming platform.
- **JUnit**: Testing framework for Java applications.
- **Mockito**: Mocking framework for unit testing.
- **Maven**: Build automation tool.

## Learning Highlights
1. **Spring Security**:
   - Implemented role-based access control with `@PreAuthorize`.
   - Configured stateless authentication using JWT.

2. **Redis**:
   - Used for caching journal entries to reduce database load.
   - Integrated with Spring Boot using `spring-boot-starter-data-redis`.

3. **Kafka**:
   - Configured Kafka producers and consumers for journal events.
   - Ensured reliable message delivery and event processing.

4. **Testing**:
   - Created unit tests with JUnit and mocked dependencies using Mockito.
   - Achieved high test coverage for critical features.
